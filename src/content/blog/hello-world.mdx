Building a personal site is a great way to dogfood the tools you love. This iteration leans on the **Next.js App Router**, server components for data loading, and a tiny token-based design system.

Highlights:

- MDX for writing posts in the same repo as code.
- A theme system driven by CSS variables and `next-themes`.
- Subtle motion via Framer Motion to keep the UI lively without distracting.

If you want to extend this setup, add more MDX files under `src/content/blog`, and the list + routes are generated automatically.
